# History

1.00 Release Version

1.01 Make sure to have the ships and shipsgroup file actually point at the new Behemoth Raider for SCA and HAT. Also change file names to ensure less of a chance of conflict with future mods and expansions. Note any existing Behemoth Raider you may have created will be wiped.
